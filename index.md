<u><b>Scientific Name:</b></u> Paludis Cornua

<u><b> Characteristics:</b></u> Paludis Cornua has slimy, black skin with green dots; two, short, light blue horns; one, big, green eye; two, blue arms; two dark purple legs with webbed feet; and four, big, brown teeth.

<b>Body:</b> Paludis Cornua has slimy skin for a body. Skin is porous, so Paludis Cornua likely lives in a warm habitat that requires skin to keep itself cool. Paludis Cornua also has a black body with green dots. If Paludis Cornua lives in a dark environment, then the black body could serve as camouflage. If there are bioluminescent species living near Paludis Cornua, then the green dots could add to the camouflage. 

<b>Eyes:</b> Paludis Cornua has one big green eye. Since Paludis Cornua likely lives in a dark place, a larger eye could cover a wider field of vision and Paludis Cornua may be able to see more as a result. The green pigment could have similar advantages to the green dots on the body.

<b>Teeth:</b> Paludis Cornua has four big, brown, relatively flat teeth. Paludis Cornua likely eats plants, because flatter teeth are better for chewing.

<b>Horns:</b> Paludis Cornua has two, short, light blue horns. Paludis Cornua could use its horns to defend itself from predators or to fight for mates. Shorter horns use less energy and could still be used to fight for mates or act as a defense mechanism against predators.

<b>Limbs:</b> Paludis Cornua has long, dark blue arms with four digits and an opposable thumb on each hand. An opposable thumb indicates a need for grasping things. Paludis Cornua might use its opposable thumbs to pull leaves off of a plant to eat. Paludis Cornua could also potentially use its thumbs to build better shelter. Paludis Cornua also has dark purple legs with webbed feet. Webbed feet are commonly used for swimming and moving in water, so it is likely that Paludis Cornua is an aquatic monster that uses its webbed feet to swim and move in the water.

<b><u>Similarities to IRL Animals:</u></b> Paludis Cornua has many adaptations similar to other animals through convergent evolution. Salamanders are an example of one of those animals. Like Paludis Cornua, salamanders have slimy skin and webbed feet. Salamanders use their webbed feet for swimming - much like I theorize the Paludis Cornua would. Salamanders need their slimy skin because the mucus’s moisture helps a salamander’s body properly function. Humans have hands with opposable thumbs like Paludis Cornua does. Humans use their opposable thumbs to help them grasp objects - much like I suspect Paludis Cornua would. A microscopic water animal called a copepod also shares convergent traits with Paludis Cornua - specifically the one eye. Copepods use their single eye to distinguish light and dark in water environments. Paludis Cornua might use its eye in a similar fashion.
